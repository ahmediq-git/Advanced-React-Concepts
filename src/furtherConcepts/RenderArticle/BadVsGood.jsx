// ❌ BAD!
// This creates a new `ChildComponent` reference every time!
function ParentComponent() {
    function ChildComponent() {
      return <div>Hi</div>;
    }
  
    return <ChildComponent />;
  }

//   This creates a child component on rerender each time
// . If an element in a given spot has changed to a different type, such as going from <div> to <span> or <ComponentA> to <ComponentB>, React will speed up the comparison process by assuming that entire tree has changed. As a result, React will destroy that entire existing component tree section, including all DOM nodes, and recreate it from scratch with new component instances.



// Define separately outside of the component
// ✅ GOOD
// This only creates one component type reference
function ChildComponent() {
    return <div>Hi</div>;
  }
  
function ParentComponent1() {
    return <ChildComponent />;
}

// Note that key isn't actually a real prop - it's an instruction to React.
//  React will always strip that off, and it will never be passed through to the
//  actual component, so you can never have props.key - it will always be undefined.

// ✅ Use a data object ID as the key for list items
// todos.map((todo) => <TodoListItem key={todo.id} todo={todo} />);

// Everything in react is immutable and if we change anything mutably like:
// const onClick = () => {
//   const newTodos = todos.slice();
//   newTodos[3].completed = true;
//   setTodos(newTodos);
// };


// Then react wont know whether to rerender or not as the reference has not changed and that can mess things up
// So changes should be done immutably so the reference change and adjust accordingly
// Bottom line: React, and the rest of the React ecosystem, assume immutable updates. Any time you mutate, you run the risk of bugs. Don't do it.

//In context, when the provider value changes, only those child components consuming the value will rerender


// The React Component Right Under Your Context Provider Should Probably Use React.memo
// This will mean that not everything will rerender in the child components and only those using the provider will re render

// function ChildComponent() {
//   return <GrandchildComponent />
// }

// const MemoizedChildComponent = React.memo(ChildComponent);

// function ParentComponent() {
//   const [a, setA] = useState(0);
//   const [b, setB] = useState("text");

//   const contextValue = {a, b};

//   return (
//     <MyContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
//       <MemoizedChildComponent />
//     </MyContext.Provider>
//   )


// If you're exclusively using function components and useSelector, then it's likely that larger
//  parts of your component tree will re-render based on Redux store updates than they would with
//   connect, since there aren't other connected components to stop those render cascades from continuing down the tree.

// Use context if:
// // You just need to pass some simple values that don't change often
// // You have some state or functions that need to be accessed through part of the app, and you don't want to pass them as props all the way down
// // You want to stick with what's built in to React and not add additional libraries
// Use (React-)Redux if:
// // You have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app
// // The app state is updated frequently over time
// // The logic to update that state may be complex
// // The app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people
