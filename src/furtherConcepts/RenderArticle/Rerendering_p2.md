# Rerendering (Continued)

### Common Mistake

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
    const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  
    const handleClick = () => {
      setCounter(counter + 1);
      // ‚ùå THIS WON'T WORK!
      console.log(counter);
      // Original value was logged - why is this not updated yet??????
    };
  }
```


It wont print the new value, it will print the the old value

Although renders are the normal expected part of how React works, it's also true that
that render work can be "wasted" effort at times. If a component's render output didn't
change, and that part of the DOM didn't need to be updated, then the work of rendering that 
component was really kind of a waste of time.

React component render output should always be entirely based on current props and current component
state. Therefore, if we know ahead of time that a component's props and state haven't changed, we should 
also know that the render output would be the same, that no changes are necessary for this component, and 
that we can safely skip the work of rendering it.

When trying to improve software performance in general, there are two basic approaches:
 1) do the same work faster, and
 2) do less work. Optimizing React rendering is primarily about doing less work by skipping rendering
components when appropriate.

React re-renders all nested components even if their props haven't changed.React re-renders all nested components even if their props haven't changed.


That also means there's no point in trying to optimize renders for "host components" like a `<div>` or a `<button>` by wrapping them up in a `React.memo()`. There's no child component underneath those basic components, so the rendering process would stop there anyway.


As mentioned above, you don't have throw useMemo and useCallback at every single function or object you pass down as a prop - only if it's going to make a difference in behavior for the child. (That said, the dependency array comparisons for useEffect
do add another use case where the child might want to receive consistent props references, which does make things more complicated.)
